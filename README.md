## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A bit about me:

  Iâ€™m an R&D Systems Engineer, which is a mix of a Technology Business Analyst and Systems Analyst. Right now, Iâ€™m working towards becoming a QA Engineer by taking a bootcamp with TripleTen. Iâ€™m also learning    Python, SQL, Power BI, and Data Analytics principles through Udemy courses. Plus, Iâ€™ve got experience working on embedded systems projects.
